This repo is meant to my rust-learning progress and motivate me to code something in rust dayly.

# Why rust
I love low-level programming languages. I started with C and C++ and to this day I feel the most confortable coding in C++. Rust is a better version of that, with a higher level of memory safety, a friendlier compiler and similar performance.
